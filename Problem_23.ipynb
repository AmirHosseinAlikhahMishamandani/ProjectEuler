        "\n",
        "## 1. Function: `get_divisors_sum(n)`\n",
        "This function calculates the sum of proper divisors of a number `n`. Proper divisors of a number are the divisors excluding the number itself.\n",
        "\n",
        "### How it Works\n",
        "- It starts with a sum of `1` since `1` is a divisor of every number.\n",
        "- It iterates through all possible divisors up to the square root of `n`.\n",
        "- For each divisor found, it adds both the divisor and its complement (n / divisor) to the sum.\n",
        "- It ensures not to double-count the divisor in case of perfect squares.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 2. Function: `find_abundant_numbers(limit)`\n",
        "This function finds all abundant numbers up to a given `limit`. An abundant number is one for which the sum of its proper divisors exceeds the number itself.\n",
        "\n",
        "### How it Works\n",
        "- It iterates through numbers from 12 (the smallest abundant number) to the given `limit`.\n",
        "- For each number, it checks if the sum of its proper divisors (using `get_divisors_sum`) is greater than the number.\n",
        "- If it is, the number is abundant and added to the list.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 3. Function: `sum_of_non_abundant_sums(limit)`\n",
        "This function calculates the sum of all numbers up to a `limit` that cannot be expressed as the sum of two abundant numbers.\n",
        "\n",
        "### How it Works\n",
        "- First, it finds all abundant numbers up to the `limit` using `find_abundant_numbers`.\n",
        "- It creates a boolean array `can_be_written_as_abundant_sum` to track if a number can be written as the sum of two abundant numbers.\n",
        "- It then iterates through pairs of abundant numbers. For each pair, it calculates their sum.\n",
        "- If the sum is less than or equal to the `limit`, it marks the corresponding index in the boolean array as `True`.\n",
        "- Finally, it sums up all indices in the boolean array that are still `False`, meaning these numbers cannot be written as the sum of two abundant numbers.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Final Step\n",
        "- The limit is set to 28,123, and `sum_of_non_abundant_sums(limit)` is called to find the required sum."
