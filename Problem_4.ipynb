        "\n",
        "To find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers, we can use a brute force approach. Here's how the algorithm works:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Initialize Variables:** Set a variable to store the maximum palindrome found (`max_palindrome`) and initialize it to zero.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Outer Loop for First Number:** Loop through all 3-digit numbers for the first multiplier. A 3-digit number ranges from 100 to 999.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Inner Loop for Second Number:** For each number in the outer loop, loop through all 3-digit numbers for the second multiplier.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Check for Palindrome:** For each product of the two numbers, check if it's a palindrome. To check for a palindrome, you can convert the number to a string and compare it with its reverse.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Update Maximum Palindrome:** If the product is a palindrome and greater than the current `max_palindrome`, update `max_palindrome` with this product.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Optimization:** Since we are looking for the largest palindrome, we can start the loops from 999 and go downwards. This ensures that we find the largest palindrome earlier.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Result:** After completing the loops, the value in `max_palindrome` will be the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers."
