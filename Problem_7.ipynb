        "Here's a step-by-step description of the `find_prime_at_index` algorithm:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Define a function called `find_prime_at_index` that takes an integer argument `index`.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Check if the given `index` is non-positive; if it is, return `None`. This step ensures that the input is valid and the index is a positive integer.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Initialize a list called `primes` to hold prime candidates, starting with the first prime number, 2. This list will be used to store the prime numbers found during the execution of the algorithm.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Initialize a variable called `candidate` to 3, which is the next odd number after 2. This variable will be used to iterate through odd numbers and test them for primality.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Enter a `while` loop that continues searching for prime numbers until we have found the desired number of primes (given by `index`).\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Inside the loop, assume that the current `candidate` is prime until proven otherwise by initializing a Boolean variable called `is_prime` to `True`.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Calculate the square root of the `candidate` and store it in a variable called `sqrt_candidate`. This step optimizes the algorithm by only checking for divisors up to the square root of the candidate.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. Enter a nested `for` loop to check if the `candidate` is divisible by any known prime numbers stored in the `primes` list. This loop iterates through the primes list.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. If the current prime number in the loop is greater than the square root of the `candidate`, exit the loop. This is because if the candidate has no divisors up to its square root, it must be prime.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. Check if the `candidate` is divisible by the current prime number. If it is, mark `is_prime` as `False` and exit the loop. This means the candidate is not prime.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. If the candidate is determined to be prime (i.e., `is_prime` is still `True`), add it to the `primes` list.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. Move on to the next candidate by incrementing `candidate` by 2. This is because even numbers greater than 2 are not prime, so we only test odd numbers for primality. This step ensures that the algorithm progresses through odd numbers only.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. Repeat steps 6-12 until the length of the `primes` list reaches the specified `index`, indicating that we have found enough prime numbers.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Return the prime number at the specified `index`, which is the last element in the `primes` list.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. Example usage: Find the 10,001st prime number by calling `find_prime_at_index(10001)`, and store the result in the `result` variable. Then, print the result.\n",
        "\n",
        "This algorithm efficiently finds prime numbers by iteratively checking odd candidates for primality and maintaining a list of known primes to use as divisors in the primality test. It ensures that the specified number of prime numbers is found before terminating."
